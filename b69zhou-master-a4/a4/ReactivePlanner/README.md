Assumption: It is assumed that the number in the start time textbox can never exceed the number in the end time textbox. Therefore it is suggested that the user edits the start time first, since if end time is editted first then in the middle of user backspacing, the start time would default to 0 since at this point the start time number is usually bigger than it in the end time.
